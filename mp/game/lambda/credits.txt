Here's a list of credits for the assets I've used thus far. If I missed something, by all means contact me at mossj32@gmail.com, or shadowmavrks@gmail.com.
If you're the owner of an asset used here, and I fucked up on the usage terms(ie. lack of permission) email me, we can negotiate whether you want me to remove it,
or make satisfactory changes to allow it's use to continue.
